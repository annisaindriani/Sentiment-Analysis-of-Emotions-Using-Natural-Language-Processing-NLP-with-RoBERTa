# Sentiment Analysis of Emotions Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with RoBERTa 
## Description
This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis system for a hospital in Indonesia, focusing on discerning emotions from questionnaire responses. The dataset, containing 20,000 rows with text and sentiment labels, was processed to prepare it for analysis. This involved several preprocessing steps, including lemmatization and the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts such as tokenization, using a pretrained RoBERTa model to enhance feature extraction.

The dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets, allocating 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. A model was then developed based on established architecture, incorporating layers such as LSTM and batch normalization to improve performance. The model was trained until satisfactory accuracy was achieved. Finally, a performance analysis was conducted using the testing dataset, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, F1-Score, and accuracy, providing insights into the modelâ€™s effectiveness in accurately classifying sentiments from the responses.
